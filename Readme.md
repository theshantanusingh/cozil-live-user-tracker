# ðŸ‘¥ Live User Tracking Service

This is a standalone **WebSocket-based microservice** designed to track online users in real time across your web platform â€” ideal for features like **"X users online"** or **live presence indicators** (e.g., Omegle-style platforms). This is being used in COZIL, one of application I have createad.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Real-time tracking of online users.
- Broadcasts the total number of connected users.
- Assigns persistent user IDs using `localStorage`.
- Works independently as a microservice (runs on a separate port).
- Easily pluggable into any frontend via `socket.io-client`.

## ðŸ§± Tech Stack

- **Node.js** with **Express**
- **Socket.IO** for WebSocket communication
- **UUID** for generating user IDs
- **CORS** and **Helmet** for security
- **Pino** for logging
